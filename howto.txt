To build all the VHDL files (and most importantly the initialization for the SRAM),
one has to run 'make soc_run' or similar in the 'sim' directory.

After that, GoWIN IDE can be used to synthesize the project.

To download the project, SSH into wafer1, and:

open a serial console:

picocom /dev/ttyUSB1 --baud 115200 --imap lfcrlf --echo

to start a serial console on the second serial port of the JTAG programmer (use ctrl-a ctrl-x to exit).

in a different SSH session:

mount /samsung-laptop
cd /samsung-laptop/tantos/unic/cores/unic_t80/sim
. ./fpga_run

This will download the FPGA.
